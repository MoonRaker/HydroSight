# HydroSight
Python language version of the HydroSight Matlab toolbox was created by Tim Peterson (Monash University) and others. 

The HydroSight Matlab toolbox was first described in the following publication:

Peterson, T. J. and Western, A. W. (2014). Nonlinear time‚Äêseries modeling of unconfined groundwater head. Water Resources Research, 50(10), 8330-8355.

and subsequently implemented in the following publications: 

Shapoori, V., Peterson, T. J., Western, A. W., and Costelloe, J. F. (2015). Decomposing groundwater head variations into meteorological and pumping components: A synthetic study. Hydrogeology Journal, 23(7), 1431-1448.
